# Slador188 - The Intel 80188 single board computer

This repository holds all the source code and other resources used in my **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)** series where I build a 16-bit Intel 80188 single board computer.

Each directory contains: 
- **src** - current source code of the firmware used in the videos
- **schematics** - schematics of the computer
- **tutorials** - source code of some proof-of-concept projects and some test code related to the computer
- **external** - 3rd party libraries used in the project (git submodules)

The firmware in the **src** in by all means not complete and is a subject of an ongoing development documented in the **[videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)**.

The **schematics** have been created with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Please note, that I have been using **version 7**, so the schematics may not be down-compatible with older versions of KiCad.
There are also PDF versions of each of the schematics included.
